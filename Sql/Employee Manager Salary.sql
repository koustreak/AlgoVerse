You have been tasked with creating a table that compares an employee\'s salary to that of their manager and to the average salary of their department.

It is expected that the department manager\'s salary and the average salary of employee\'s from that department are in their own separate column.

Order the employee\'s salary from highest to lowest based on their department.

Your output should contain the department, employee id, salary of that employee, salary of that employee's manager and the average salary from employee's within that department rounded to the nearest whole number.

Note: The Company have requested that you not include the department manager\'s salary in the average salary for that department in order to avoid skewing the results. Managers of each department do not report to anyone higher up; they are their own manager.
